# data-structures-algos

This is a folder I will use to dump notes from my studies in data structures & algorithms. Most of this will be derived from two courses. 

After recognizing I didn't know enough from the first to make progress or get the inside jokes.. I decided to take the second, which is longer and more thorough first

Also the first was based on typescript and I wanted a js focused class to begin with
